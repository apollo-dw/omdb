osu! map database - rating website

this is the source code to OMDB. I have no clue how to help people contribute so I literally cannot write a guide yet. Keep in mind the code sucks too because this is my first time doing a web project... I promise I can do better :sob:

Please leave issues with the website here in this PR thank you

**Where is the chart update / beatmap retrieval scripts?**
Elsewhere. If any of you twerps want to look at it then I can reveal the algorithm whenever needed
